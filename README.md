# Data-Mining-in-Engineering

Focus area: Data analysis using Python.

ðŸ”‘ **key learnings:**
This course covers the theory and applications of data mining in
engineering.

It reviews fundamentals and key concepts of data
mining, discusses important data mining techniques, and presents
algorithms for implementing these techniques. 

In specific, this course covers data mining techniques for data preprocessing, association rule
extraction, classification, prediction, clustering, and complex data
exploration. 

Data mining applications in several areas including
manufacturing, healthcare, medicine, business, and other service
sectors are discussed.

## [#1 Explore Housing Price Trends](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%231%20Explore%20Housing%20Market.ipynb)

Navigating and visualizing the housing data using Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Explore, clean, visualize, and analysis data effectively.


## [#2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Wine dataset](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%232%20PCA%20for%20Wine%20dataset.ipynb)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction, it transform a large set of variables into a smaller set that still contains most of the important information from the original set. It can be applied to the Wine dataset, which contains chemical properties of wine varieties.
